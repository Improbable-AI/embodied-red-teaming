# embodied-red-teaming

Embodied Red-Teaming (ERT) is an automated red-teaming evaluation method for benchmarking language-conditioned robot models, including robotic foundation models. See the paper here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.18676.

This repository will be updated soon to reproduce the CALVIN, RLBench, and OpenVLA experiments. For now, you can use `generate_instructions.py` to generate instructions using ERT.
